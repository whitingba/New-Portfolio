            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">You might be wondering what brought me to where I am today. I
                think some of my interests today were formulated by my early pursuits in college. While I did not
                ultimatly end up where I imagined and it took a meandering path, I am grateful for all the experiences
                and opportunities I was awarded as they have formed who I am today. <br> <br>
                I entered college as an art major. During my first
                semester I remembered aproject I had in grade school that sparked my interest in Architecture and
                decided to take a drafting classes. I quickly changed my major to Architecture after just one drafting
                class. I really liked the smooth, clean lines that I created drafting. About a years later I
                turned 21 and decided I wanted more independence and left my family home and the state of Michigan and
                moved to Denver, Colorado. <br> <br>
                I do not want to bore you with the details, but even though I tried my hardest to finish my college
                degree in Architecture it just was not in the cards. I ended up with a degree in Finance and have spent
                the last 15 years working in the mortgage industry. The only reason I mention the art and architecture
                is because I think it helped formulate my desire to head into this future career path in coding. <br>
                <br>
                I met my husband during my years studying Architecture and we started a family. I still love art and I
                still have a passion for Architecture, but they have become more hobbies and my passion for Architecture
                developed into a desire to photograph Architecture instead of create it. I am ending a career of 16
                years working in the mortgage industry and helping people become homeowners. I am now ready for my next
                phase in life and the teacher and teaching assistants at the DU Coding Bootcamp are helping to make it a
                reality.
